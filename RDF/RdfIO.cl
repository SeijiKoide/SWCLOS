;;;; RDF input functions are hidden from user's view.
;;;
;;; To parsing XML documents, dedicated input functions are developed. 
;;; The motivation of this development is as follows. The transition machine is usually modeled 
;;; for parsing the syntax of languages. However, the expression of the syntax specification of a 
;;; particular language and the transition machine for the language is very different and difficult 
;;; to imagine one to another. On the other hand, Ratfor and C (maybe) language need only one 
;;; character peeking to parse them. Generally, any number of peeking allows us to parse any context 
;;; free language. For XML parsing, in the experience, nine peeking characters is enough to parse 
;;; XML for "\<![CDATA[", maybe. 
;;;
;;; These special functions allow programmers to peek any numbers of characters in the stream.
;;; These functions are very useful to parse XML documents without state transition mechanism. 
;;; We can decide what kind of data comes up next by peeking a number of characters. 
;;;
;;; If you want to show what characters remain in the buffer, use the command <expose-buf> without 
;;; parameters. The buffer has two pointers to the start and the end of sequence of characters.
;;; * ((#\null) #\null) indicates null list.
;;; * ((a b c #\null) #\null) indicates three characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in buffer.

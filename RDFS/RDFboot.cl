;;; The twisted relation between rdfs:Class and rdfsClass, that is, rdfs:Class is a super 
;;; class and an instance of rdfsClass produces a trick of (cl:typep rdfs:Class rdfs:Class).
;;; Note that every method defined at rdfs:Class affects rdfs:Class itself. Therefore, the 
;;; world is closed by the membership loop of rdfs:Class just like cl:standard-class in CLOS.
;;;
;;; The twisted relation between rdfs:Resource and rdfs:Class yields semantics of RDFS, that is, 
;;; (cl:typep rdfs:Resource rdfs:Class) and (cl:typep rdfs:Resource rdfs:Resource).
;;;
;;; The method <class-direct-instances>, which maintains direct instances of a class, is 
;;; inherited to rdfs:Class and rdfsClass. So, subclasses of rdfs:Resource and rdfs:Class, 
;;; including rdfs:Class itself can hold their instances.

;;;; Pseudo class of rdfs:Resource is defined.

;;; object, the  object is defined as an instance of |rdfs:Resource| rather than rdfs:Resource. 
;;; Or else, when a slot would be demanded to a tentatively created object in forward-referencing, 
;;; it would causes the slot definitions at rdfs:Resource. Then, when a proper definition comes up, 
;;; the slot definitions would be created at the proper class. As a result, rdfs:Resource would 
;;; become to have wasteful slot definitions for many objects in the universe. To work around this 
;;; phenomenum, |rdfs:Resource| is used instead of rdfs:Resource in forward-referencing. 
;;; |rdfs:Resource| prevents to create wasteful slots at rdfs:Resource instances.

  "|rdfs:Resource| is a pseudo rdfs:Resource in order to work around the slot inheritance of temporal definition.
The rule of rdf4 entails a subject and an object as an instance of rdfs:Resource. However the proactive application of
this rule causes the slot definition inheritance to the instances of rdfs:Class and rdfs:Datatype and amounts to 
wasteful slots in every objects. To cope with this problem, rdf4 treats |rdfs:Resource| metaobject instead of 
rdfs:Resource.")

;;;; How to Compute a Type Value in Effective Slot Definition
;;;
;;; Since the function of gx:subtypep in RDF is the same as that of cl:subtypep, the 
;;; computation of type option in <compute-effective-slot-definition-initargs> for excl::std-class is 
;;; also useful for the effective slot definition for rdf properties. Note that the ACL original 
;;; algorithm for type value collection collects the type value in direct-slot-definitions at every 
;;; superclass of the target class, and makes the conjunction of them. See the following example.
;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; (defclass C1 () ((s :type cl:number)))

;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; This computational result by native routine of ACL is sound, if members of conjunct are not 
;;; disjoint each other, whereas it might be not minimal expression as conjunction, since ACL does 
;;; not reduce the result such as conjunctive normal form (CNF). However, if you take care of the 
;;; disjointness between cl:float and cl:fixnum, then such result will make no sense. In SWCLOS, the 
;;; notion of disjointness is taken care for not only OWL universe but also RDF universe. In 
;;; SWCLOS, the clash by disjointness is directed as follows.

;;;; Hierarchy and Relation around Property
;;; An rdf property is an instance of rdf:Property. An rdf property as rdf-object has a slot 
;;; <property-slotds> for book-keeping, which holds a list of slot definitions on the property 
;;; (e.g., eslotd1, eslotd2 eslotd3 for rdfs:label, see below). Each slot definition keeps a class of 
;;; subjective object in subject-type option. Therefore, we can retrieve every triples with 
;;; respect to a property (called the extension of property). The object in triple is obtained by 
;;; accessing slot value to the object with the predicate (slot-name) in the triple.

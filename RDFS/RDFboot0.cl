;;; The aim of this file is to establish the complex relation of meta-circularity in RDF 
;;; incrementally step by step. Loading this file yealds the following hierachical structure 
;;; at the end.

;;;  ..., :  class/instance relation, the direction of class is upward and left to right.
;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; The twisted relation between rdfs:Class and rdfsClass, that is, rdfs:Class is a super 
;;; class and an instance of rdfsClass produces a trick of (cl:typep rdfs:Class rdfs:Class).
;;; Note that every method defined at rdfs:Class affects rdfs:Class itself. Therefore, the 
;;; world is closed by the membership loop of rdfs:Class just like cl:standard-class in CLOS.
;;;
;;; The twisted relation between rdfs:Resource and rdfs:Class yields semantics of RDFS, that is, 
;;; (cl:typep rdfs:Resource rdfs:Class) and (cl:typep rdfs:Resource rdfs:Resource).
;;;
;;; The method <class-direct-instances>, which maintains direct instances of a class, is 
;;; inherited to rdfs:Class and rdfsClass. So, subclasses of rdfs:Resource and rdfs:Class, 
;;; including rdfs:Class itself can hold their instances.

;;; class of rdfs:Class, because rdfs:Class is a superclass of rdfsClass and rdfsClass is a class of 
;;; rdfs:Class. Thus, all methods are for instances of rdfs:Class is effective for rdfs:Class itself.

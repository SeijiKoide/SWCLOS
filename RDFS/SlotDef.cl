;;;; Slot definitions for SWCLOS
;;;
;;; The standard slot definition in CLOS (mop:standard-slot-definition) is also a CLOS object 
;;; and includes the information for slot creation of instances, i.e., initargs, type, 
;;; documentation and so on. Hereafter, we call a slot in slot definition object an option of 
;;; slot. So, we say, for example, the standard slot definition has an initargs option, a type 
;;; option, and documentation option, and so on. 
;;;
;;; The slot with respect to rdf property is an instance of <Property-direct-slot-definition>, 
;;; which is a specialized class of <mop:standard-direct-slot-definition>. In addition to CLOS 
;;; native options, <Property-direct-slot-definition> has a <subject-type> option, and the slot 
;;; with respect to owl specific property is an instance of <OwlProperty-direct-slot-definition>, 
;;; which is a specialized class of <Property-direct-slot-definition>. It has a <maxcardinality> 
;;; and a <mincardinality> option. 
;;;
;;; The <type> option of CLOS native options is used as the constraint for the slot value type, 
;;; and <maxcardinality> and <mincardinality> options are used as cardinality constraints for a 
;;; number of slot values. 
;;;
;;; The <subject-type> option in <Property-direct-slot-definition> is used as a inverse link to a 
;;; subject class to which the slot definition itself is attached. Note that a 
;;; <subject/predicate/object> triple in RDF is realized as instance-object/slot-name/slot-value 
;;; in CLOS. Thus, the specialized slot-definition <Property-effective-slot-definition> and 
;;; <OwlProperty-effective-slot-definition> in SWCLOS represents a set of triples such that the 
;;; <subject> is typed to <subject-type> and <predicate> is the same as <slot-name>. Therefore, 
;;; all triples <subject/predicate/object> can be retrieved by collecting all slot values through 
;;; this inverse link from these slot-definitions using slot-value function. Note that all slot 
;;; definitions on a property is booked into the property resource objects.

;;;; How a Type Value is set in Direct Slot Definition
;;;
;;; There are four ways in RDF and two in OWL to suppy the type option in initargs parameter for 
;;; shared-initialize method of <Property-direct-slot-definition>, i.e., 
;;; # When a property is defined with domain constraint, <add-direct-slots-to-domain> function adds 
;;;   a direct slot definition into the domain class. In this case, the range constraint of property 
;;;   is retrieved from the property object and supplied for type option in the slot definition.
;;;   See <add-direct-slots-to-domain>.
;;; # When an RDF instance or class is newly made or reinitialized, <ensure-class-slotds> is invoked 
;;;   for the class of the object to ensure class slot definitions. In this case, the range constraint 
;;;   of property is retrieved from the property object and supplied for type option in the slot 
;;;   definition. See <ensure-class-slotds>.
;;; # When change-class is invoked, if the instance to be changed has a slot value and the new class 
;;;   has no definition on the slot, the old slot definition is copied into the new class. 
;;;   See <change-class>:before(rdfs:Resource rdfs:Class). 
;;; # When <put-value>(rdfs:Resource rdf:Property) is invoked but the subject inherits no slot definition, 
;;;   the slot definition is added to the class of subject. See <put-value>.
;;; # When an instance of owl:allValuesFromRestriction is made or redefined, the constraint is transfered 
;;;   into the type option in the slot definition that is attached to the restriction with slot name 
;;;   from onProperty value. See <shared-initialize>:after(owl:allValuesFromRestriction).
;;; # When an instance of owl:someValuesFromRestriction is made or redefined, the constraint is transfered 
;;;   into the type option in the slot definition that is attached to the restriction with slot name 
;;;   from onProperty value. See <shared-initialize>:after(owl:someValuesFromRestriction).
;;;
#|
;; To get a newest option value of type in current situation, use <mop:slot-definition-type>. 
;; It is specialized for <Property-direct-slot-definition> and <Property-effective-slot-definition> 
;; in order to activate a get daemon. 
;; See also <mop:slot-definition-type> before method in GxType module.

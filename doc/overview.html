<H1>Overview of SWCLOS Code</H1>

<P>We had already published many papers and documents on SWCLOS, including 
<a href="http://research.nii.ac.jp/TechReports/09-014E.html">SWCLOS user's manual</a>. They are delivered together 
with this document from <a href="http://www-kasm.nii.ac.jp/~koide/SWCLOS2-en.htm">SWCLOS home page</a> or you can 
search and easily find them over the Internet. However, while the concept and the aim of SWCLOS is very clear, 
it is difficult to read and understand the program code. The reason is partly because SWCLOS requires knowledge of 
RDF(S) and OWL in addition to knowledge of CLOS plus the Meta-Object Protocol (MOP), and partly because many 
fragments of procedures in program are allocated to many classes as methods and it makes hard to seize the effective 
functions realized by the combination of several methods as a whole program. 

<P>The aim of this document is to support readers to read the SWCLOS program code and understand it. It is 
desirable that readers have knowledge on CLOS and MOP. The book by G. Kiczales, 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744/">
"The Art of the Metaobject Protocol"</a> helps for lispers who are not so matured on MOP. 
The documents on <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF(S)</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/OWL/">OWL</a> 
from W3C and papers on SWCLOS are also prerequisite for readers. 

<P>To generate this document from program source code automatically, the document generation system by 
<a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/lisp/doc/overview.html">Norvig's AIMA Lisp program</a> is borrowed and 
tailored by author. This is very effective to save the cost for documentation and keep the concistency of 
information.
</P> 

<P>This document includes followings:

<UL>
<LI> An <A HREF="entries.html">alphabetical index</A> of all names in the code.
<LI> The Lisp source code itself for <a href="../RDF">RDF</a>, <a href="../RDFS">RDFS</a>, <a href="../OWL">OWL</a>, 
and <a href="../NTriple">NTriple</a> as a browsable directory.
<LI> The following subsystems are organized into subdirectories.<BR><BR>
<UL>
<!--
<LI TYPE="circle"> <A HREF="overview-UTILITIES.html">Utilities</A>: 
Basic functions that are loaded every time, and commonly used by other subsystems. This module includes 'utilities' file from <I>AIMA</I>.
